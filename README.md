In recent decades astronomical data in a variety of media have been accumulating at increasing rates. In recent years mapping
The sky in search of meeting planets through projects such as Kepler and Tess has yielded data on unprecedented scales,
The keys to human science analysis and decipherment are therefore improved tools for display and analysis.
In this project we will allow the search and visualization of planetary data originating from databases accessible via the API Web, in order to
 focus efforts we will deal with the data of planets and objects that are in "our" solar system.
The project contains:

Main technologies:
- C# and WPF
- 3-layer architecture and MVVM
- Relay commands
- Material design
- Connection with NASA api
- Database - SqlServer with EntityFreamwork
- Firebase - For storing images
- Imagga - AI service for automatic image taging
- Asynchronous and parallel programming
